# Latex Parser TS

## Why

The goal of this project is to create a lightweight (at least as much as JavaScript allows) library that will parse a LaTeX file that can be used in any environment where JavaScript can be used. The reason why this isn't a fork of [the wonderful Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) is that Overleaf relies on a LaTeX compiler to generate a valid representation. Thus, it requires a backend and to be hosted.
